? A comment is everything in between two question marks: '? ?'
  and can be multi-line.

? Variable Declaration ?

x := nil;
a := 10, b := 20;
? variables can contain $ and ' ?
$var' := 0;

a := 1;
b := a, c := b;

? Data Types ?

$nil := nil,
$byte := 255,
$node := {
	x := 1,
	y := { n := 123 },
	x := nil
},
$function := func x, y: x:
	x := x + y;
end;

? Nil 
	The 'nil' data type represents the ausence of value, it's useful on data-structures.

	'nil' it's a reserved keyword that means a object which not contains nothing.
?

? Bytes
	A byte it's an unsigned integer lesser than 256.
?

b1 := 0, b2 := 255, b3 := 128;

? Nodes

? Functions 
	Functions are a first-class values. To declare a function we must assign it to
	a variable.

	The syntaxis to create a function is the following:
		func arg1, arg2, arg3: result:
			?? Block ??
			result := [arg1, arg2, arg3];
		end
	
	The keyword 'func' followed by the list arguments th function takes on a call,
	then a variable name that may be declared inside the function or exist in the scope
	then a block of code and ending with the 'end' keyword.
?

f := func x, y: x:
	x := x + y;
end,

f2 := func x, y: nil:
	if x > y then
		present(x);
	else
		if y > x then
			present(y);
		else
			present(x, y);
		end
	end
end,

f2' := func x, y: nil:
	if x > y then
		present(x);
		exit;
	end

	if y > x then
		present(y);
		exit;
	end

	if x == y then
		present(x, y);
		exit;
	end
end;

? Notes on functions:
	* The argument list may be empty sothe function won't need any argument at moment of call.

	* The 'return variable' may be not declared inside the function, but it has to exist somewhere
	in the scope at the moment of call. (an example is the function f2)

	* The 'exit' keyword it's like a return, in the sense it automatically breaks the flow of the
	function. (example of use in f2')
